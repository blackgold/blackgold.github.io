I get phone call every morning from my wife asking if I locked the home and if I turned off the gas stove. I simply reply yes although I should watch live feed to look at front door and gas stove to be certain. This christmas weekend I have decided to solve this problem by calibrating camera to look at door and stove and find if its on or off and send alert.
